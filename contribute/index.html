    <h2>So you want to make a pull request</h2>
    <p>
    Pull requests are the way that community members like you can get your code
    pulled into the official Torque 3D repository for everyone else to use. We
    accept community contributions that align with our vision for the engine -
    especially bug fixes, enhancements to existing features, and revisions of
    old, slow, or ugly code. Pull requests are the way that code gets reviewed
    before it's accepted into the engine - even cod that we, the Steering Committee,
    write ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to ensure the quality of the engine code going into the future, we
    have strict rules about what code we can and cannot accept. We also have
    some soft guidelines that inform our decision-making progress in trickier
    cases.
    </p>

    <h2>Pull request rules</h2>
    <p>
    Pull requests not adhering to these rules <i>cannot</i> be accepted, so pay attention!
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Obviously, your contribution cannot contain any code that is not
        legally compatible with Torque 3D's MIT license. In addition, to legally
        protect the engine and everyone affiliated with it, we require that all
        contributors create an account on
        <a href="http://garagegames.com">GarageGames.com</a> and sign the Open
        Source Software Agreement there. For more information on the OSSA, please visit
        <a href="https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/wiki/Contributing#open-source-software-agreement">this page in our wiki</a>.</li>

        <li>Contributions must adhere to our
        <a href="https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines">code style guidelines</a>.</li>

        <li>Pull-requests against the master branch cannot be accepted. All requests
        must go to development, or an appropriate topic or maintenance branch.</li>

        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    In many cases, if any of these rules are breached, we will first ask the contributor
    to resubmit their pull request, or add commits to it that resolve our issues.
    In exceptional cases, a committee member may perform that work themselves.
    Sometimes, we may also ask contributors to rebase large numbers of commits
    into a single commit before the request is pulled.
    </p>

    <h2>Pull request guidelines</h2>
    <p>
    Here are some of the things we look for in a great pull request. These aren't
    hard-and-fast rules, but following these guidelines will increase the chances
    that your request is pulled!
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Our favourite requests are ones that work directly towards the goals
        laid out in our <a href="{{page.root}}/engine#roadmap">roadmap</a>. We
        are more likely to help out and fix slightly broken pull requests if
        they align with our goals, and chances are your request will move faster
        through our process.</li>

        <li>Each pull request should be <i>focused</i> and <i>concise</i>. If
        it has a very clear intent and a small set of changes towards a specific
        goal, it's easy for us to decide whether we want it, and to then test it
        and make sure it works as advertised and doesn't break things.</li>

        <li>If you're fixing a bug, we need you to provide steps to reproduce it
        so we can verify that exists and that your patch actually does fix it.
        We'd also appreciate platform and compiler information.</li>

        <li></li>
