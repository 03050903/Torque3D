                Frozen Endzone is the premier tactical future sports game! 
                It combines the strategic depth of Frozen Synapse with completely
                original creative gameplay and a thrilling futuristic aesthetic. 
                You must design a play to get the ball into your opponent's endzone,
                using the stadium's procedurally-generated terrain to your advantage.

            <h3 class="media-heading">Rendering</h3>
            <p>
            Torque 3D includes both a high-performance forward-rendering basic
            lighting engine, and a deferred-rendering advanced lighting mode so
            you can tailor your game to meet the needs of different customers.
            The modern rendering system includes per-pixel lighting, normal and
            parallax mapping, and materials generated by a high-level editor, or
            written from scratch in GLSL/HLSL. The engine comes with shaders
            for water, sky and sun, and many common material types.
            </p>
            <p>
            The engine also has a powerful PostFX system allowing you to create
            custom post-processing effects. It ships with buit-in effects including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HDR/light adaptation</li>
                <li>Depth of field</li>

                <li>Screen-space ambient occlusion and FXAA</li>

            <p>
            Torque 3D comes with everything you need to construct environments
            and levels from your assets. Shapes are imported in Collada DAE format
            and placed in the in-game editor. Switch to playing through your level

                <li>The shape editor provides tools for previewing and touching
                up your shapes after import.</li>
                <li>The road and river editor modes make it simple to place paths
                that become solid roads, flowing rivers or decal tracks across
                the terrain.</li>
                <li>A fully-featured material editor means you don't have to touch
                a line of shader code to create great-looking visuals.</li>
                <li>The GUI editor lets you place HUD and menu elements in an
                easy-to-use WYSIWYG environment.</li>
                <li>Torque 3D will automatically reload assets that are changed

            <h3 class="media-heading">Networking</h3>
            <p>
            Since its inception as the engine behind the online shooter Tribes 2,
            Torque has consistently provided high performance, reliable networking
            for fast-paced online games. The engine has networking built into 
            its core, allowing you to quickly get up and running with networked
            games.
            </p>
            <p>
            Time-invarying data is transferred via datablocks at client join time,
            reducing the amount of data that needs to be networked during
            gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
            Torque uses a <em>server authoritative</em> networking model that
            helps you to reduce cheating and exploitation. At the same time,
            the game state is predicted and interpolated locally so each client
            experiences a smooth view of the action.

            <h3 class="media-heading">Scripts and source code</h3>
            <p>
            When you get Torque, you get everything. The entire source code is
            yours to modify under the permissive MIT license. The codebase is mature
            and extensible with a plugin system, allowing you to easily add features
            of your own, or from other libraries, to each project.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you're not the recompiling type, Torque provides a scripting engine
            using a custom C-like language called TorqueScript. You can create
            whole games without touching a line of C++. Check this out:

        Please note that the roadmap is currently being debated by the Steering Committee.
        This version represents our rough ideas and intentions and may change when we
        settle on an actual plan! When that happens we will document future engine
        versions here with their planned outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>Short-term</h3>
    <p>
    The theme of our immediate efforts will be cleaning up the state of the repository,
    forging new links with the community, and putting in place procedures that will
    make the Committee more effective in the future.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete and launch this website!</li>
        <li>Set up automated testing to increase ease of maintenance.</li>
        <li>Merge (possibly into unstable branches) or reject all outstanding pull-requests.
        In particular:
        <ul>
            <li>A usable CMake alternative to the current Project Generator</li>
            <li>64-bit-ready changes</li>
            <li>VS2013 compatibility</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Middle-term</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Linux and OSX support via OpenGL rendering layer.</li>
        <li>DirectX 11 and PhysX 3.3 support.
        <li>New modular script templates and content distribution.</li>
        <li>More difficult existing pull-requests, particularly improvements to the TorqueScript language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long-term</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean up engine source code (e.g. use of non-STL container replacements, signed/unsigned mismatches).</li>
        <li>Modularise scripting engine, paving the way for other scripting languages.</li>
        <li>Entity/component system replacing hardcoded gameplay classes.</li>
        <li>Overhaul editor suite</li>
