            <h4 class="media-heading">Rendering</h4>
            <p>
            Torque 3D includes both a high-performance forward-rendering basic
            lighting engine, and a deferred-rendering advanced lighting mode so
            you can tailor your game to meet the needs of different customers.
            </p>
            <p>
            The modern rendering system includes per-pixel lighting, normal and
            parallax mapping, and materials generated by a high-level editor, or
            written from scratch in GLSL/HLSL. The engine comes with shaders
            for water, sky and sun, and many common material types.
            </p>
            <p>
            The engine also has a powerful PostFX system allowing you to create
            custom post-processing effects. It ships with buit-in effects including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HDR/light adaptation</li>
                <li>Depth of field</li>
                <li>Lens flare and sun rays</li>
                <li>Screen-space ambient occlusion and FXAA</li>
                <li>Refraction, reflection and glow</li>

            <p>
            Torque 3D comes with everything you need to construct environments
            and levels from your assets. Shapes are imported in Collada DAE format
            and placed in the in-game editor. Switch to playing through your level
            with one press of a button.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Powerful terrain editor that allows you to import terrains
                or sculpt them yourself by hand.</li>
                <li>The shape editor provides tools for previewing and touching
                up your shapes after import.</li>
                <li>The road and river editor modes make it simple to place paths
                that become solid roads, flowing rivers or decal tracks across
                the terrain.</li>
                <li>A fully-featured material editor means you don't have to touch
                a line of shader code to create great-looking visuals.</li>
                <li>The GUI editor lets you place HUD and menu elements in an
                easy-to-use WYSIWYG environment.</li>
                <li>Torque 3D will automatically reload assets that are changed
                outside the editing environment, enabling speedy development
                iteration.</li>
                <li>Editor modes are implemented as plugins, so you can add your
                own custom modes.</li>

            <p>
            Since its inception as the platform for the online shooter Tribes 2,
            the Torque networking platform has consistently provided high performance
            and reliability for fast-paced online games. The engine has networking
            built into its core, including interpolation and prediction to smooth
            over high-latency environments and provide instant feedback to clients.

            <p>
            Torque 3D provides a plugin system for physics. There is a simple
            implementation built-in which can be easily swapped out for PhysX or
            Bullet libraries.

            <p>
            When you get Torque, you get everything. The entire source code is
            yours to modify under the permissive MIT license. The codebase is mature
            and extensible with a plugin system, allowing you to easily add features
            of your own, or from other libraries, to each project.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you're not the recompiling type, Torque provides a scripting engine
            using a custom C-like language called TorqueScript. You can create
            whole games without touching a line of C++.

        When I finally found myself adrift and free, I had but little idea of my surroundings. Never a competent navigator, I could only guess vaguely by the sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the equator. Of the longitude I knew nothing, and no island or coast-line was in sight. The weather kept fair, and for uncounted days I drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun; waiting either for some passing ship, or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land. But neither ship nor land appeared, and I began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastnesses of unbroken blue.

        The change happened whilst I slept. Its details I shall never know; for my slumber, though troubled and dream-infested, was continuous. When at last I awaked, it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as far as I could see, and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away.
